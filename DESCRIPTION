Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of multivariate
    polynomials with rational coefficients. This package is strongly
    inspired by the 'spray' package. It provides a function to 
    compute Gröbner bases (reference <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16721-3>). It 
    also includes some features for symmetric polynomials, such as the Hall
    inner product.
    The header file of the C++ code can be used by other packages. It 
    provides the templated class 'Qspray' that can be used to represent and 
    to deal with multivariate polynomials with another type of coefficients.
