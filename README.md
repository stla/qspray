***R package for multivariate polynomials with rational coefficients.***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package is strongly inspired by Robin Hankin’s **spray** package.
The C++ implementations are very similar.

``` r
library(qspray)
```

The **qspray** package provides the `qspray` objects, which represent
multivariate polynomials whose coefficients are rational numbers.

## Creating a `qspray` polynomial and arithmetic

The easiest way to build a multivariate polynomial with **qspray** is to
start by introducing the generating variables with the help of the
`qlone` function and then to combine them with arithmetic operations:

``` r
x <- qlone(1); y <- qlone(2); z <- qlone(3)
( pol <- 4*x^2 + "1/2"*y - 5*x*y*z/3 )
## 4*x^2 - 5/3*x.y.z + 1/2*y
```

I often like to use a function like this:

``` r
f <- function(x, y, z) {
  4*x^2 + y/2 - 5*x*y*z/3
}
f(x, y, z)
## 4*x^2 - 5/3*x.y.z + 1/2*y
```

Or maybe you prefer to define the polynomial by giving it as a string:

``` r
qsprayMaker(string = "4 x^(2) + 1/2 x^(0, 1) - 5/3 x^(1, 1, 1)")
## 4*x^2 - 5/3*x.y.z + 1/2*y
```

As you want, but this method is not highly robust. And it is not very
easy to figure out what is the monomial represented by a string such as
`"x^(i,j,k)"` (this is `x^i*y^j*z^k`).

Some arithmetic on this polynomial:

``` r
-pol
## -4*x^2 + 5/3*x.y.z - 1/2*y
2 * pol
## 8*x^2 - 10/3*x.y.z + y
pol / 2
## 2*x^2 - 5/6*x.y.z + 1/4*y
"5/3" * pol
## 20/3*x^2 - 25/9*x.y.z + 5/6*y
pol + 5
## 4*x^2 - 5/3*x.y.z + 1/2*y + 5
pol - gmp::as.bigq("2/5")
## 4*x^2 - 5/3*x.y.z + 1/2*y - 2/5
pol^2
## 16*x^4 - 40/3*x^3.y.z + 25/9*x^2.y^2.z^2 + 4*x^2.y - 5/3*x.y^2.z + 1/4*y^2
```

Two polynomials can be added and multiplied:

``` r
pol1 <- pol
pol2 <- pol
pol1 + pol2
## 8*x^2 - 10/3*x.y.z + y
pol1 - pol2
## 0
pol1 * pol2
## 16*x^4 - 40/3*x^3.y.z + 25/9*x^2.y^2.z^2 + 4*x^2.y - 5/3*x.y^2.z + 1/4*y^2
```

## Evaluating a `qspray`

Use `evalQspray` to evaluate a polynomial for some values of the
variables:

``` r
evalQspray(pol, c("1", "2", "3/2"))
## Big Rational ('bigq') :
## [1] 0
```

Alternatively, you can convert the polynomial to a function:

``` r
g <- as.function(pol)
g("1", "2", "3/2")
## [1] "0"
```

You can pass the strings you want as the arguments of this function:

``` r
g("x", "y", "z")
## [1] "(24*x^2-10*x*z*y+3*y)/6"
g("x+1", "2*x", "y^2")
## [1] "((-10)*x^2*y^2+12*x^2+(-10)*x*y^2+27*x+12)/3"
```

The output of `g("x+1", "2*x", "y^2")` is the expression of a bivariate
polynomial. You can get it as a `qspray` polynomial with the help of the
function `changeVariables` (see section **Transforming a `qspray`**).

If you want a function returning numerical approximations, use the
option `N=TRUE`:

``` r
h <- as.function(pol, N = TRUE)
h("1", "2", "3/2")
## [1] 2e-29
h("x", "y", "z")
## expression(4 * x^2 - 1.6666666666 * x * y * z + 0.5 * y)
h("x+1", "2*x", "y^2")
## expression(-3.3333333333 * x^2 * y^2 + 4 * x^2 - 3.3333333333 * 
##     x * y^2 + 9 * x + 4)
```

You can also perform “partial evaluation” of a `qspray`, that is to say
replacing only certain variables. This is done by using the function
`substituteQspray` and indicating the variables to be kept with `NA`:

``` r
substituteQspray(pol, c("1", NA, "3/2"))
## -2*y + 4
f(gmp::as.bigq(1), y, gmp::as.bigq("3/2"))
## -2*y + 4
g("1", "y", "3/2")
## [1] "2*(2-y)"
h("1", "y", "3/2")
## expression(-2 * y + 4)
```

## Showing a `qspray`

You can control the way of printing a `qspray` with the help of the
function `showQsprayOption<-`. By default, the monomials of a `qspray`
are printed in the style of `x^2.y.z^3` if there are at most three
variables, otherwise they are printed like `x1^2.x2.x3^3`:

``` r
set.seed(3141)
( qspray <- rQspray() ) # a random qspray
## -2*x^4.y^3.z^4 - 4*y^2.z^2
qspray + qlone(4)^99
## -2*x1^4.x2^3.x3^4 - 4*x2^2.x3^2 + x4^99
```

If you want to always use the second way, you can do:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "x") <- "x"
qspray
## -2*x1^4.x2^3.x3^4 - 4*x2^2.x3^2
```

If you want to restore the way `qspray` objects were printed in previous
versions, you can do

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showMonomial") <- showMonomialOld()
qspray
## -2*x^(4, 3, 4) - 4*x^(0, 2, 2)
```

There are three possible show options that can be passed to
`showQsprayOption`:

- The most general show option is `"showQspray"`. A `showQspray`
  function, that is to say a function appropriate for the `"showQspray"`
  option, must be a function which transforms a `qspray` to a string.
  The package provides some helper functions to built such functions,
  like `showQsprayXYZ` and `showQsprayX1X2X3`. With `showQsprayXYZ`, you
  can choose the letters you want to denote the variables:

``` r
f <- showQsprayXYZ(c("A", "B", "C"))
f(qspray)
## [1] "-2*A^4.B^3.C^4 - 4*B^2.C^2"
```

With `showQsprayX1X2X3`, you choose only one letter for the variables
which will be indexed:

``` r
f <- showQsprayX1X2X3("X")
f(qspray)
## [1] "-2*X1^4.X2^3.X3^4 - 4*X2^2.X3^2"
```

Once you have constructed such a function, you pass it as a show option
by doing `showQsprayOption(qspray, "showQspray") <- f`.

- The second possible show option is `"showMonomial"`, to control the
  way the monomials are printed. Actually in the two above examples of
  `showQsprayXYZ` and `showQsprayX1X2X3` we only changed the way the
  monomials are printed. Indeed, these two commands are equivalent:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showQspray") <- showQsprayXYZ(c("A", "B", "C"))
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showMonomial") <- showMonomialXYZ(c("A", "B", "C"))
```

and these two commands are equivalent as well:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showQspray") <- showQsprayX1X2X3("X")
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showMonomial") <- showMonomialX1X2X3("X")
```

But the `showQspray` functions allow finer control, e.g. they allow to
control the multiplication symbol which separates a coefficient and a
monomial within a term.

- Finally there is the show option `"x"`. Setting this option to a
  letter `x`:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "x") <- x
```

is equivalent to:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showMonomial") <- showMonomialX1X2X3(x)
```

But `showMonomialX1X2X3` also allows to control the way the individual
powers are collapsed, e.g. `"x^2.y.z^3"` (the default) or `"x^2*y*z^3"`,
or `"x^2yz^3"`. If the dot is nice for you, use the `"x"` option, that’s
less code to type.

By the way, a `qspray` object is an S4 object with two slots: `powers`
and `coeffs`. The `powers` slot is a list of vector of exponents and the
`coeffs` slot is a character vector, whose each element is coercable to
a `bigq` number by an application of the function `gmp::as.bigq`. The
`showMonomial` functions act only on the `powers` slot.

When an arithmetic operation is performed between two `qspray` objects,
the show options of the first one are passed to the result, *if
possible*:

``` r
qspray + qlone(4)^99
## -2*X1^4.X2^3.X3^4 - 4*X2^2.X3^2 + X4^99
```

For example, this is not possible if you specify only three letters for
the variables and you perform an operation with a `qspray` involving the
fourth variable:

``` r
showQsprayOption(qspray, "showMonomial") <- showMonomialXYZ(c("a", "b", "c"))
qspray
## -2*a^4.b^3.c^4 - 4*b^2.c^2
qspray + qlone(4)^99
## -2*a1^4.a2^3.a3^4 - 4*a2^2.a3^2 + a4^99
```

## Exact integration over a simplex

The package provides a function which returns the exact value of the
integral of a polynomial with rational coefficients over a simplex whose
vertices have rational Cartesian coordinates:

``` r
# variables
x <- qlone(1); y <- qlone(2); z <- qlone(3)
# polynomial
P <- x^4 + y + 2*x*y^2 - 3*z
# simplex (tetrahedron) vertices
v1 <- c(1, 1, 1)
v2 <- c(2, 2, 3)
v3 <- c(3, 4, 5)
v4 <- c(3, 2, 1)
# simplex
S <- rbind(v1, v2, v3, v4)
# integral
integratePolynomialOnSimplex(P, S)
## Big Rational ('bigq') :
## [1] 1387/42
```

## Transforming a `qspray`

Let’s take a `qspray` polynomial:

``` r
f <- function(x, y, z) {
  4*x^2 + y/2 - 5*x*y*z/3
}
x <- qlone(1); y <- qlone(2); z <- qlone(3)
P <- f(x, y, z)
```

You can get a derivative of this polynomial:

``` r
derivQspray(P, i = 2) # derivative w.r.t y
## -5/3*x.z + 1/2
```

You can permute the variables of this polynomial:

``` r
swapVariables(P, 1, 3) == f(z, y, x)
## [1] TRUE
```

You can perform a change of variables on this polynomial:

``` r
changeVariables(P, list(x+1, 2*x, y^2)) == f(x+1, 2*x, y^2)
## [1] TRUE
```

## Gröbner bases

Finally, let us mention the `groebner` function, which computes a
Gröbner basis of the ideal generated by a list of `qspray` polynomials:

``` r
f <- qsprayMaker(string = "x^(3) - 2 x^(1,1)")
g <- qsprayMaker(string = "x^(2,1) - 2 x^(0,2) + x^(1)")
groebner(list(f, g))
## [[1]]
## x - 2*y^2 
## 
## [[2]]
## y^3
```

As an application of Gröbner bases, there is the function
`isPolynomialOf`. This function checks whether a polynomial can be
obtained by substituting the variables of a polynomial with some given
polynomials: given a `qspray` polynomial `Q` and some `qspray`
polynomials `P1`, …, `Pn`, does there exist a polynomial function `f`
such that `Q = f(P1, ..., Pn)`? If this is true, the `isPolynomialOf`
function also returns `f`.

## Packages using ‘qspray’

There are packages depending on the **qspray** package (some of them are
not on CRAN yet):

- [**polyhedralCubature**](https://github.com/stla/polyhedralCubature):
  this package uses the `integratePolynomialOnSimplex` function to get
  the exact integral of a multivariate polynomial over a polytope.

- [**jack**](https://github.com/stla/jackR): Jack polynomials.

- [**resultant**](https://github.com/stla/resultant): resultant,
  subresultants, and greatest common divisor of two `qspray`
  polynomials.

- [**ratioOfQsprays**](https://github.com/stla/ratioOfQsprays):
  fractions of `qspray` polynomials.

- [**symbolicQspray**](https://github.com/stla/symbolicQspray):
  multivariate polynomials whose coefficients are `ratioOfQsprays`
  fractions of polynomials; they represent multivariate polynomials with
  parameters.

## Using the C++ code in another package

The three packages **jack**, **ratioOfQsprays** and **symbolicQspray**
use some C++ code based on the header file of the C++ code of
**qspray**. If you want to use it in your package too, include the
following instruction in the DESCRIPTION file:

``` yaml
LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, qspray
```

Then you can use the **qspray** header file in your C++ code by using
the namespace `QSPRAY`.

The header file provides the templated class `Qspray`. An object of type
`Qspray<T>` represents a multivariate polynomials whose coefficients are
represented by the objects of the type `T`. For example, multivariate
polynomials with numeric coefficients can be represented by the objects
of type `Qspray<double>` (so I should have chosen another name since `Q`
is here to indicate the field of rational numbers). The class `Qspray`
provides the operators `==`, `!=`, `+`, `-`, `*` and the power for the
objects of type `Qspray<T>` as long as the operators `==`, `!=`, `+`,
`-` and `*` are available for the type `T`. So you don’t have to
implement the comparison operators nor the arithmetic operations for the
`Qspray<double>` polynomials if you instantiate this type. The class
`Qspray` also provides a function to calculate derivatives. This class
is included in the namespace `QSPRAY` which also includes a function
performing the division of two multivariate polynomials but it is
restricted to polynomials with rational coefficients. Anyway it would
not be a good idea to use the algorithm performed by this function for
polynomials whose coefficients type is not an “exact type”, such as
`double`. If you want to use `Qspray<T>` with an exact type `T` and if
you need the division, send me a few words about your use case and I
will see whether I can help. I will probably remove the division from
the namespace `QSPRAY`. I originally included it to use it in the
**ratioOfQsprays** package, but I finally used the division provided by
the **CGAL** library instead, which is faster.

A few words about the implementation. The class `Qspray<T>` has only one
member object: an object of type `Polynomial<T>`, which is an alias of
the type `std::unordered_map<std::vector<int>, T>` (plus a template
argument for the hasher). So a `Polynomial<T>` object is a map whose
keys are `std::vector<int>` objects and whose values are `T` objects. An
element of this map represents a term of the polynomial: a key
represents a monomial, e.g. the vector `{2,1,3}` represents the monomial
`x^2*y*z^3`, and the value attached to this key represents the
coefficient of this monomial. This way to represent a multivariate
polynomial has been copied from Robin Hankin’s **spray** package,
without which the **qspray** package would have never existed.
